    "During the Pandemic, Public Health England (PHE) launched a Covid-19 dashboard. This timely service came with an Application Programming Interface (API) allowing users programmatic access to the data for the purpose of creating visualisations or data analysis. Interestingly, it also included a wrapper library written in Python, that made access to the data seamless. At the end of 2023, the PHE dashboard was replaced by the UK Health Security Agency dashboard (UKHSA dashboard). This new API, at the time of writing in the Beta stage, includes data on various infectious diseases including respiratory and gastrointestinal, bloodstream infections, and vaccine-preventable diseases. The data are better organised and documented, and many of the quirks of the old API have been fixed. An interesting feature of the new system is that all of its code has been open-sourced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Fetching and Storing the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was accessed through a public API provided by the UKHSA. The specific metric I worked with was: COVID-19_cases_rateRollingMean This metric represents the 7-day rolling average of daily case rates. I queried the API with relevant parameters such as geography (England), year (e.g., 2022), and page size. the data returned was in JSON format, which I saved locally in a file named:RollingMeancases.json This allowed the dashboard to load \"canned\" data on startup — useful in case the API is unavailable or if the user prefers not to wait for live data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Data Wrangling (Cleaning and Structuring) The raw JSON data was a list of dictionaries, each containing: A date An age group A sex field (ignored for our purposes) A metric_value (the case rate) This structure isn't suitable for direct plotting, so I performed the following data wrangling steps: Loaded the JSON data into Python. Converted the list of dictionaries into a Pandas DataFrame. Parsed the date strings into actual datetime objects. Pivoted the DataFrame so that: Rows = dates Columns = age groups (e.g., '0_4', '20_29', '60+', 'all') Values = rolling mean case rate (metric_value) Filled missing values with 0.0 to avoid plotting issues. This final DataFrame (meandf) became the foundation for all visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Static and Monthly Aggregated Visualizations With the cleaned DataFrame: I created a line plot showing case rates for a specific age group ('all') over time. I also aggregated the data monthly, normalised the values (so each month’s total equals 100%), and displayed it as a horizontal stacked bar chart to highlight differences in age group contributions over time. These charts helped explore both trends over time and relative comparisons between age groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Adding Interactivity with ipywidgets To make the dashboard more dynamic, I used the ipywidgets library to add interactive controls: A Dropdown widget to select an age group. A RadioButtons widget to toggle between linear and logarithmic scales on the y-axis. These controls were linked to a callback function (plot_age_group) using wdg.interactive_output(). Each time the user changes a selection, the graph updates automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output is an interactive dashboard that: Loads and processes COVID-19 case data Provides users with control over what age group they want to explore Allows switching between linear and log scales for better insight Optionally supports data refresh from the live API The whole dashboard is built inside a Jupyter Notebook and can be launched as a standalone web app using Voila, which hides the code and displays only the UI and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technologies Used\n",

    " The code above implements a 'Refresh' button that allows users to update the dataset dynamically by retrieving the most recent data from an external API. This feature is useful when working with live datasets, such as those from public health APIs, where the data changes frequently. Instead of manually re-running code or reloading the notebook, users can simply click the button to fetch the latest available data. When the button is clicked, it triggers the api_button_callback() function. This function calls access_api(), which is where the actual connection to the external data source should happen. Although the access_api() function is currently a placeholder, it is intended to return new raw data from the API. Once the data is retrieved, it is cleaned and structured using a separate function called wrangle_data(), and the result replaces the existing global variable df, which is used to power your graphs or visualisations. However, graphs in Jupyter or Voilà dashboards do not update automatically when data changes. To solve this, the function also includes a call to refresh_graph(), which simulates user interaction with the widgets and forces the graph to redraw using the updated data. To improve user experience, the button also changes its icon to a green checkmark once the process is successfully completed, giving clear visual feedback that the data has been refreshed. Overall, this interactive feature is essential in making your dashboard dynamic, user-friendly, and responsive to new information. It enables users to work with real-time data confidently, while reducing the manual steps needed to keep visualisations current."
