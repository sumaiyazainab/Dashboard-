    "This is a template for your DIY Disease Tracking Dashboard, to which you can add the code you developed in the previous notebooks. The dashboard will be displayed using [voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), a Python dashboarding tool that converts notebooks to standalone dashboards. Contrary to the other libraries we have seen, the ```voila``` package must be installed using *pip* or *conda* but it does not need to be imported - it rather acts at the level of the notebook server. Package ```voila``` is already installed on the QMUL JupyterHub as well as in the Binder - to install it locally, follow the [instructions](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html) online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, Voila acts by **running all the cells in your notebook** when the dashboard is first loaded; it then hides all code cells and displays all markdown cells and any outputs, including widgets. However, the code is still there in the background and handles any interaction with the widgets. To view this dashboard template rendered in Voila click [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fsmeraldi/diy-covid19dash/main?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2FDashboard.ipynb)."

The instructions may seem a bit involved, but the actual steps are surprisingly easy - we will be going through them together during a live session.

    "## Extracting public health data -Rolling Mean COVID-19 Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "During the Pandemic, Public Health England (PHE) launched a Covid-19 dashboard. This timely service came with an Application Programming Interface (API) allowing users programmatic access to the data for the purpose of creating visualisations or data analysis. Interestingly, it also included a wrapper library written in Python, that made access to the data seamless. At the end of 2023, the PHE dashboard was replaced by the UK Health Security Agency dashboard (UKHSA dashboard). This new API, at the time of writing in the Beta stage, includes data on various infectious diseases including respiratory and gastrointestinal, bloodstream infections, and vaccine-preventable diseases. The data are better organised and documented, and many of the quirks of the old API have been fixed. An interesting feature of the new system is that all of its code has been open-sourced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Fetching and Storing the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was accessed through a public API provided by the UKHSA. The specific metric I worked with was:\n",
    "COVID-19_cases_rateRollingMean\n",
    "This metric represents the 7-day rolling average of daily case rates. I queried the API with relevant parameters such as geography (England), year (e.g., 2022), and page size.\n",
    "the data returned was in JSON format, which I saved locally in a file named:RollingMeancases.json\n",
    "This allowed the dashboard to load \"canned\" data on startup â€” useful in case the API is unavailable or if the user prefers not to wait for live data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Data Wrangling (Cleaning and Structuring)\n",
    "The raw JSON data was a list of dictionaries, each containing:\n",
    "A date\n",
    "An age group\n",
    "A sex field (ignored for our purposes)\n",
    "A metric_value (the case rate)\n",
    "This structure isn't suitable for direct plotting, so I performed the following data wrangling steps:\n",
    "Loaded the JSON data into Python.\n",
    "Converted the list of dictionaries into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "Parsed the date strings into actual datetime objects.\n",
    "Pivoted the DataFrame so that:\n",
    "Rows = dates\n",
    "Columns = age groups (e.g., '0_4', '20_29', '60+', 'all')\n",
    "Values = rolling mean case rate (metric_value)\n",
    "Filled missing values with 0.0 to avoid plotting issues.\n",
    "This final DataFrame (meandf) became the foundation for all visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Static and Monthly Aggregated Visualizations\n",
    "With the cleaned DataFrame:\n",
    "I created a line plot showing case rates for a specific age group ('all') over time.\n",
    "I also aggregated the data monthly, normalised the values (so each monthâ€™s total equals 100%), and displayed it as a horizontal stacked bar chart to highlight differences in age group contributions over time.\n",
    "These charts helped explore both trends over time and relative comparisons between age groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Adding Interactivity with ipywidgets\n",
    "To make the dashboard more dynamic, I used the ipywidgets library to add interactive controls:\n",
    "A Dropdown widget to select an age group.\n",
    "A RadioButtons widget to toggle between linear and logarithmic scales on the y-axis.\n",
    "These controls were linked to a callback function (plot_age_group) using wdg.interactive_output(). Each time the user changes a selection, the graph updates automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output is an interactive dashboard that:\n",
    "Loads and processes COVID-19 case data\n",
    "Provides users with control over what age group they want to explore\n",
    "Allows switching between linear and log scales for better insight\n",
    "Optionally supports data refresh from the live API\n",
    "The whole dashboard is built inside a Jupyter Notebook and can be launched as a standalone web app using Voila, which hides the code and displays only the UI and output.\n",
    "\n",
    " Technologies Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, JSON)\n",
    "ipywidgets (for interactive controls)\n",
    "Voila (for dashboard deployment)\n",
